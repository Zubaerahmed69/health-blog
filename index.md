# Impact of IT in Healthcare System

![Screenshot](./Assets/hero.jpg)

In this modern era, from transportation to manufacturing to education, Information technology impacting strongly in every industry. The Health care industry has significantly upgraded and transformed by the help of information technology. After the implementation of IT in healthcare its benefits both medical professionals as well as patients. Patients can choose from a variety of minimally invasive procedures that are less uncomfortable and have better recovery times.

Another most important use of IT in health care is to manage data and patients records. At the time of COVID-19 pandemic most of the countries given lock down and maintaining social distancing. On that situation Information technology impacted a lot by providing remote consultations with experts, and the availability of various mobile apps have helped non COVID patients to receive improved patient care and quality healthcare experiences. Healthcare information technology is significant because it give more accurate, actionable, and accessible information which is better and faster.

The information technology impacted and transformed the healthcare industry a lot by many sources. Using of Artificial intelligence, big data, Health apps, Telemedicine and many more have changed the whole health care system and make it better, safer, and faster. In this blog I will try to expose them all.

## Telemedicine
Telemedicine means giving clinical care virtually by using technology from a distance. Telemedicine uses electronic and telecommunication technology and devices to exchange of medical information, despite a person and their doctor not being in the same place. The concept of telemedicine was predicted by Luxembourgish–American editor and magazine publisher Hugo Gernsbacher in 1925. The "teledactyl," as Gernsback's invention was dubbed, would enable doctors to not only see their patients through a viewscreen, but also to touch them from a great distance with spindly mechanical arms. He correctly foresaw modern telemedicine.

Telemedicine offers a range of benefits, including convenience, savings, more relevant assessments, and involvement of family members in an individual's care. However telemedicine has drawbacks too. The Hackers or criminals may hack the patient data because it’s communicates with an unencrypted networks. In emergency case implementation of telemedicine may delay the treatment process because a doctor is unable to give life support care or laboratory test digitally.

Sometimes it’s really challenging to find a trustable and authentic Digital platform. However day by day telemedicine become more famous. It works really well when the patients doesn’t require any laboratory test or physical examination. In this busy world telemedicine is a convenient option for those who cannot go to the doctor’s chamber and prefer to stay home.

## Artificial intelligence(AI) In Healthcare
By the development of advanced computer science and informatics Artificial Intelligence(AI) become the most important part of healthcare system. We cannot define artificial intelligence in one technology or system ,rather than we can call it collection of technologies. There are numerous impact of AI in health care system which helps to digitalized the overall healthcare system and make easier and safer treatment in short time.

Some particular AI technologies has high importance to healthcare system. Machine learning , Natural language processing, Rule-based expert systems, Physical robots, Robotic process automation, applications etc has impacted highly rather than other technologies. The uses of AI in healthcare totally transforming the system and give us astonishing possibilities. Improving diagnostic application is one of the most useful technology in healthcare system. By the use of Ai technologies images could be analysis automatically which will remove the possibility of error in human reading.

Its really tough to find out and discover new drugs from the large amount of database. By implementation of AI now Its not that much hard to discover drugs by analysis previous data. The uses of AI automated chat system could give the patient fasted primary solution. Now the doctor and patient conversation could be recorded and converted into text with the help of voice assistant which helps the save many hours . Recently AI robots are helping doctors to do many critical surgery and the performed really good. Overall, we can claim that artificial intelligence is fast pushing the boundaries to create revolutionary improvements in the healthcare sector.

Future Ai should be viewed as an ethical use of medical technology knowledge rather than as a doctor replacement.. AI should be the second observer who alerts the sonographer that in which part they have to pay attention highly. I hope that in the future the use of artificial intelligence will keep improving the healthcare system through accurate diagnosis, better prediction, and treatment and also reduce the cost of it.

## Healthcare Technology Trends And Innovations

While discussing about the technology trends and innovation in healthcare atfirts Big data comes to my mind . Big data in healthcare makes it possible for the entire sector to benefit from in-depth research projects. Access to various population groups is now greater and more varied. They might also rely on previously published articles for detailed meta-analyses. This can be utilized to automatically identify risk factors, provide the best preventative therapy, reduce costs, and overall enhance quality of life by comparing patient data with that of thousands of other patients.

Thanks to technology improvements, communication within healthcare companies has significantly improved. Today, medical professionals can communicate and share knowledge in the field through the use of media like video, online discussion forums, and real-time meeting capabilities. The internal electronic medical records are accessible to all crucial departments and healthcare experts. This improves case management, counseling, and patient rehabilitation.

Electronic medical records can be maintained centrally online and contain all patient histories, test results, diagnoses, and relevant information. With the help of the data, it is possible to identify particular health patterns and deliver more precise and targeted therapy. Medical billing systems enable hospitals, clinics, and doctors' offices to function much more effectively. Due to online document storage and information retrieval, employees won't need to trawl through filing cabinets and drawers. You can upload and quickly search the most recent version of a resource.

In order to improve accessibility for patients and healthcare professionals, mobile software applications, also known as mobile apps, are crucial. Mobile applications can help people manage their health and wellbeing by doing everything from reminding them to get checkups to finding basic medical information to securely allowing them to access their test results online at any time without having to make an appointment with their doctor and wait days for results.

## Conclusion
The development and advancement of health information technology will continue in the upcoming years. As they become more comfortable with diverse platforms, patients and healthcare practitioners will probably find new and useful ways to examine health data.

The advancement of health information technology holds great promise for both patients and medical practitioners with the ultimate goal of enhancing health outcomes.
